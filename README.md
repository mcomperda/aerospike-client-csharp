Aerospike C# Client Package
===========================

Aerospike C# client.  This package contains full source code for:

* **Aerospike.sln**    
	C# library and demonstration programs with full functionality.  Supported compile targets are AnyCPU, x64 (64-bit) and x86 (32-bit).  The projects are:
	
	* **AerospikeClient**    
		C# client library.
	* **AerospikeDemo**    
		C# demonstration program for examples and benchmarks.
	* **AerospikeTest**    
		C# client unit tests.
	* **AerospikeAdmin**    
		Aerospike user administration.  This application is only valid for enterprise servers that are configured to require user authentication.

	Note: The old unmanaged LuaInterface Lua interpreter (written in C) has been replaced with a fully managed NeoLua Lua interpreter (written in C#) in the client's aggregation engine.  

	All compile targets are now supported.  Therefore, the AerospikeLite solution has been deleted because it is no longer necessary.
	
The solution supports the following configurations:

* Debug
* Release
* Debug IIS : Same as Debug, but store reusable buffers in HttpContext.Current.Items.
* Release IIS : Same as Release, but store reusable buffers in HttpContext.Current.Items.
